                            can. Why did Columbus travel west?
                            Why did Marco Polo head east? Because it is that pull, that unknown, that prospect of
                            adventure
                            that compels humans to seek new frontiers to explore.</span>

                            Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure. Imagine living on another planet,
                            millions of miles from the Earth; looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one of the
                            'stars' is actually the planet you were born on. Who can even envision the incredible
                            feeling of
                            being the first human in history to step out of the capsule and leave your footprint on the
                            surface of Mars? By this we implore you to not just think of that feeling for the astronaut,
                            but
                            the experience for all those watching back home. Those who observed Neil Armstrong land on
                            the
                            Moon all those years ago still remember every detail â€“ where they were, who they were with
                            and
                            how they felt. The moment the first astronauts land on Mars will be our moment to remember.

                            A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity. Where did Mars come from? Can it teach us
                            about Earth's history? Is there life on Mars? These are just three of the hundreds of
                            burning
                            questions for scientists all over the world.

                        The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any venture in any means of travel, there are
                        always things that could go wrong. In the case of Mars One, the following risks are conceivable:

                    <p class="faq-section__paragraph">Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks, if you were
                        to compare our mission to the
                        first Moon mission in 1969, it quickly becomes apparent that this mission is much safer.</p>

                <p class="travel-section__paragraph">The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than astronauts
                    currently stay on the International Space Station.

                    The precise duration of each journey depends on when it is taken. Because both Mars and Earth's
                    orbits are not perfectly circular, the time it takes to travel between them varies from six to eight
                    months.

                    When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel time for the astronauts is very important.
